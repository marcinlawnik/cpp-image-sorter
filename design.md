Use case:

The program exe is dropped into a folder containing some photos.
A list of photos is generated. The first image is loaded, and the user is able to cycle
through the images by using left and right arrows. Once a up arrow is pressed, the photo is COPIED
to the "good" directory, and once down arrow is pressed, the photo is COPIED to the "bad" directory.
Additionally, some keys can be pressed to add filters and watermatks to the photo.
Once all the photos have been cycled through and the user confirms, the actions are made permanent.

A progressbar should be displayed to make the user aware how many photos are left to be processed or decided on.
